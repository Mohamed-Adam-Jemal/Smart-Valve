# Smart Watering System with ESP32 and Arduino IoT Cloud

## Overview
This project implements an Internet of Things (IoT) application for a smart watering system using the ESP32 board and Arduino IoT Cloud. It enables remote monitoring and control of a water valve, temperature, and humidity readings displayed on an OLED screen, and integration with the Arduino IoT Cloud for real-time data visualization.

## Features
- **Remote Control:** Monitor and control the watering system from anywhere via WiFi or cellular data, using the Arduino IoT Cloud dashboard.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Display real-time temperature and humidity on a 1.3-inch OLED screen and on the Arduino IoT Cloud mobile/web app.
- **System Status Indication:** An RGB LED indicates whether the system is ON (green) or OFF (red).
- **Automatic Shutdown:** The system automatically turns off the valve after one hour to prevent accidental prolonged operation.
- **Passive Buzzer:** Provides audible alerts for valve status changes.

## Components
- **ESP32 Board:** Controls the system and connects to WiFi.
- **12V Electrical Valve:** Controls water flow.
- **Relay:** Interfaces the 12V valve with the ESP32.
- **Voltage Regulator:** Steps down voltage from 12V to 5V for the ESP32.
- **1.3-inch OLED Screen:** Displays temperature, humidity, time, date, and system status.
- **RGB LED:** Indicates system status (ON/OFF).
- **Passive Buzzer:** Provides audible alerts.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Hardware Connections**:
   - Connect the relay module to the 12V electrical valve and GPIO 33 on the ESP32.
   - Connect the passive buzzer to GPIO 17.
   - Connect the green LED to GPIO 13 and the red LED to GPIO 27.
   - Connect the OLED screen to the I2C pins (SDA and SCL) on the ESP32.
   - Ensure the ESP32 receives 5V using a voltage regulator.

2. **Arduino IoT Cloud Setup**:
   - Create an account on the Arduino IoT Cloud.
   - Add a new Thing and associate it with your ESP32 board.
   - Define properties for temperature, humidity, and the valve button.
   - Obtain and insert the Device ID and Secret Key provided by the Arduino IoT Cloud into the code.

3. **Software Configuration**:
   - Install necessary libraries in the Arduino IDE: `U8g2`, `HTTPClient`, `ArduinoJson`, `ArduinoIoTCloud`, and `Arduino_ConnectionHandler`.
   - Copy the provided code into the Arduino IDE.
   - Enter your WiFi SSID and password.
   - Upload the code to the ESP32.

## Usage
- After setup and uploading the code, the OLED screen will display real-time data including time, date, temperature, and humidity.
- Use the Arduino IoT Cloud dashboard to remotely control the valve.
- The RGB LED and OLED screen indicate system status: green for ON and red for OFF.
- The passive buzzer alerts for valve status changes.
- The valve automatically closes after one hour of operation to prevent accidental overuse.

## Future Improvements
- **Soil Moisture Sensor Integration:** Automate watering based on soil moisture levels.
- **Notifications:** Implement email or SMS alerts for critical events.
- **Mobile Application:** Develop a dedicated mobile app for enhanced user interaction and control.
- **Battery Backup:** Include a backup power solution to maintain functionality during power outages.
